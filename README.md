# FDB OTEL Exporter

The FDB OTEL exporter tails JSON FoundationDB logs and emits OTEL metrics. This project also sets up a simple local Prometheus and Grafana containers for local analysis of FDB logs. It is not intended for production use, and has only been tested locally on a Mac.

## Prerequisites

- Install Docker
- Set the `FDB_LOG_DIR` environment variable to the location of your `trace.*.json` logs files generated by FDB processes.

## Usage

Run:

```
docker compose --build -d up
```

Open `localhost:3000` in your browser and login with `admin:admin` credentials. Then navigate in Grafana to the FDB Metrics dashboard to view FDB process metrics.
